\title{Reproject ASCII raster file}
\usage{
reprojectASCII(file, direc = getwd(), NAflag = -9999, projection = "EPSG:4326")
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{ASCII file that requires reprojection}

\item{direc}{The working directory. This needs to be the same directory as the file location so the basename can be drawn and the reprojected ASCII file can be written.}

\item{NAflag}{NA value within the raster to mask when reprojecting.}

\item{projection}{The output projection in which the ASCII input requires to be reprojected to. The default value is "EPSG:4326"}
}
\value{
Same ASCII file reprojected
}
\description{
Reads and reprojects an ASCII raster file following the data acquisition with ClimateNA (or any alternative source).
}
\examples{
files <- list.files(pattern='*asc$')
for(i in files){
  reprojectASCII(i,NAflag = 32647)
}
